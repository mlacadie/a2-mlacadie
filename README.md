## Bucket List
This is a site where you can make a bucket list for achievments that you want to complete.
Type the action in the text box and press submit to add it to the table.
If the button in the completed tab is pressed, the completion value will change to yes and the derrived field, "Date Completed" will show when you completed the task.
the button in the remove tab allows you to delete the Action from the list.

For the CSS, I added a new color scheme using colors.co and changed the font.
The table is edited so that it takes up the entire width of the screen and has a 2 pixel thick border. It is also shifted down a tad too.
All text in the table is centered and some padding was added to the rows and columns.

The buttons now have curved edges and when they are hovered over, the color changes and a pointer finger cursor is showed.
The text box now takes up 35% of the width of the screen and also has curved edges as well as inreased font size.
